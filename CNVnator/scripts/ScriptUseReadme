How to use CNVnator scripts: 

1. Replace . /u/local/Modules...modules.sh with the path to the local installation of cern root or where you are able
  to access the cern_root module 

2. Replace module load cern_root with whichever command loads cern_root 

3. Specifiying variables; 
- used_bamfile is the BAM file used in processing
- There is no need to change binsize or name unless you want to manually input another name for output files that is not 
  determined by the name of the BAM file 
- CNVnatorPrefix specifies the install location of CNVnator, make sure to specify where the src folder is 
- work_dir is the output directory path 
- rootfile is the root file created during the algorithm running, no need to change unless you want a different name 
- hg10 is the reference genome file for human genome 19

4. Converting CNVnator data to VCF is still a work in progress, but you want to run cnvnator2VCF.pl which is also in the scripts folder in order to do so as CNVNator generates a text call file.
