# CNVnator

CNVnator is an algorithm based on read depth (RD), and utilizes mean-shift technique to do partitioning [1].

The script is simple, all in `CNVnator_large.job` (CNVnator does not determine sex, and assumes a male sample). 

CNVnator generates `calls.txt` files. They provided `cnvnator2VCF.pl` script to convert those kind of files to vcf files. The vcf files contain "genotype" and "copy number", which are infered from "natorRD" value. 

I also provided the code to keep DEL records in the vcf file only (`FilterDup.py`).
