Guide to working with this version of cn.mops
Specify your working directory, path to bams, and out directory within the script and everything should be working fine. This will work in the Hoffman2 system but the R script should work elsewhere as well if R is supported. The main caveat of this program is that the log files are not going to be in the specified log file in qsub, but rather in the same directory as your R script in a file called "cn.mopsRout". This file should provide a record of all the runtime messages you would normally recieve if you ran cnmops in an interactive node.
