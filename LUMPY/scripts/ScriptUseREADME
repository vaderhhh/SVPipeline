Script Usage Instructions: 

LUMPY has many funtionalities, but for now the most optimised scripts are for variant detection: 

You will need to specify several variables and paths in lumpy_variants_HZ_4-23-18.sh 
1. BAMs_to_PROCESS specifies the BAM location which you will use 
2. number_bam specifies how many bams are being processed 
3. lumpy_folder is the folder name which you want to name your outdirectory
4. scratch is the location of where you want to put your output folder, for HOFFMAN2 the scratch folder would be the best place to put it 
5. After loading the relevant modules needed, you will need to specify the location of extract_sv_reads if you want to pursue this option, just change the path of /u/home/l/lukezhan... to your own. 
6. Replace /u/home/l/lukezhan/lumpy...pairend_distro.py with your own path to the pairend_distro.py file in your LUMPY install folder. 
7. reaplce /u/home/l/lukezhan.../lumpy with the directory where you have installed LUMPY
